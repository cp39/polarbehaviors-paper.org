**Path-Dependent Equilibrium and Polarization in Public Responses to a Pandemic**

A model of dynamic game among heterogeneous agents in response to a pandemic is developed, in which the agents' communicable-activity decisions collectively
affect the transmission risk of the environment and individually affect each agent's
utility flows along with their probability of exposure to the transmission risk. Agents'
equilibrium actions exhibit (1) path-dependent dynamics when their probability of
asymptomatic infection is positive and (2) polarization when the hazard rate of expo-
sure probability exceeds their degree of risk aversion. Comparative statics analyses
show that the levels of agents' equilibrium communicable activity are nonincreasing
in their discount factor, their probability of showing symptoms upon infection, and
their expectation of suffering upon showing symptoms. If the virus persists, then
the model predicts that the only long-run equilibrium outcome is herd immunity.

**Polarized protective behaviors in response to the Covid pandemic: An empirical study of changes in time spent socializing**

This paper investigates the existence of polarized protective behaviors in response to the pandemic
using empirical analysis of data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The study finds that
the proportion of people without daily social interaction increased significantly during the pandemic
compared to the same period in 2019. Additionally, based on a counterfactual distribution estimated
using the method developed by Chernozhukov et al. (2013), the study shows that people socializing
during the pandemic would have spent similar amounts of time socializing if there were no pandemic.
These findings provide evidence supporting the existence of polarization in which some people chose safety
first and stopped socializing, while others chose to live as usual without reducing their social time during
the pandemic.

**What drives polarized preventive behaviors during the pandemic?**

Preventive behaviors in the pandemic encompass the  trade-off between the private return from social activity and the risk of getting infected. Our study demonstrates that, under plausible assumptions regarding risk exposure, the nature of such a trade-off can lead to polarized choices for a relatively homogeneous population. This finding aligns well with the prevalence of behavioral polarization in preventive measures adoption during the pandemic for a variety of domains in the survey data. We validate the theory by confronting other predictions of the theory with the data. We also argue that the polarization of the preventive choices is unlikely driven solely by a polarized distribution of the population.
